# Lesson 3 - Cleaning Data

## Background for this activity

# In this activity, youâ€™ll review a scenario, and focus on
# cleaning real data in R. You will learn more about data
# cleaning functions and perform basic calculations to gain
# initial insights into your data.
# 
# Throughout this activity, you will also have the opportunity 
# to practice writing your own code by making changes to the 
# code chunks yourself. If you encounter an error or get stuck,
# you can always check the Lesson2_Clean_Solutions .rmd file 
# in the Solutions folder under Week 3 for the complete, 
# correct code. 

## The scenario

# In this scenario, you are a junior data analyst working for 
# a hotel booking company. You have been asked to clean a 
# .csv file that was created after querying a database to 
# combine  two different tables from different hotels. 
# 
# To learn more about this data, you are going to need to use 
# functions to preview the data's structure, including its 
# columns and rows. You will also need to use basic cleaning 
# functions to prepare this data for analysis.
