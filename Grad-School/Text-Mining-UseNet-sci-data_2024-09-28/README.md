# UseNet Sci. Data Text Mining

## Overview
This project involves text mining and analysis of UseNet scientific newsgroup data. The analysis focuses on extracting patterns, performing sentiment analysis, and applying topic modeling to understand the thematic structure and sentiment within the data.

## Project Structure
- **Ibiza_Project2.R**: R script containing the data processing, analysis, and visualization steps for the project.

## Key Findings
- **Word Frequency**: Identification of frequently occurring words in scientific newsgroups.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analysis of sentiment across different scientific newsgroups.
- **Topic Modeling**: Application of topic modeling to categorize newsgroup messages into distinct themes.

## Required Packages
Ensure you have R and the following packages installed for the project:
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization
- `ggraph`: For graph visualization
- `igraph`: For network analysis
- `purrr`: For functional programming tools
- `readr`: For reading data
- `stringr`: For string manipulation
- `textdata`: For text data
- `tidytext`: For text mining
- `tidyr`: For tidying data
- `topicmodels`: For topic modeling
- `widyr`: For pairwise operations

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Packages**: Use the commands above to install the necessary packages.
2. **Load Data**: Ensure the `20news-bydate-train` dataset is available in the data directory.
3. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the R script `Ibiza_Project2.R` to perform the analysis and generate insights.

## Usage
- **Data Exploration**: Explore word frequency and sentiment patterns in newsgroup messages.
- **Text Mining**: Analyze word frequency, sentiment, and thematic structures.
- **Visualization**: Use visualizations to illustrate findings and support analysis.

## Recommendations
- **Further Research**: Explore additional text mining techniques or datasets to enhance understanding.
- **Model Refinement**: Refine analysis based on findings to improve insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of text mining techniques to analyze UseNet scientific newsgroup data, providing valuable insights into the thematic structure and sentiment within the data.
