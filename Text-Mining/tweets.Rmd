In the following analysis, we examine Twitter data pertaining to campaign tweets from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 election. First, examining tweet frequency by candidate shows their general use pattern. Next, word frequency analysis reveals the most common words used by each candidate, demonstrating their messaging focus. Next, we compare candidate word usage shows the differences in the language used by the candidates and their distinct rhetorical strategies. Then, we examine the changes in top word use over time, highlighting shifting campaign priorities. Lastly, we analyze favorites and retweets, which demonstrates a measure of how well their messages resonated with the broader public.



## Tweet Frequency by Candidate

The plot below shows the tweet frequency of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.

```{r}
# init
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidytext)

# read data
tweets <- read.csv("tweets.csv")
head(tweets)
dim(tweets) # 6444  28

# Convert the 'time' column to a datetime format
tweets <- tweets %>%
  mutate(time = ymd_hms(time))

# Filter tweets by candidate
tweets <- tweets %>%
  filter(handle %in% c("HillaryClinton", "realDonaldTrump")) %>%
  mutate(candidate = ifelse(handle == "HillaryClinton", "Clinton", "Trump"))

# Create the plot
ggplot(tweets, aes(x = time, fill = candidate)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 20, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~candidate, ncol = 1)

```
Trump maintained a  consistent tweet volume over the year, with minor spikes in the spring and fall. In contrast, Clinton's tweet activity surged starting in June, peaking in July and again in October, aligning with key campaign events like the Democratic National Convention and the final stretch before the election.

This highlights Trumpâ€™s steady use of Twitter, while Clinton increased her presence as the election approached. In other words, Trump was active on Twitter long before the presidential campaign season began.

## Word Frequency Analysis

```{r}
replace_reg <- "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|http://[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;|&lt;|&gt;|RT|https"
unnest_reg <- "([^A-Za-z_\\d#@']|'(?![A-Za-z_\\d#@]))"

tidy_tweets <- tweets %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(text, "^RT")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, replace_reg, "")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = unnest_reg) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word,
         !word %in% str_remove_all(stop_words$word, "'"),
         str_detect(word, "[a-z]"))

frequency <- tidy_tweets %>% 
  count(candidate, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  left_join(tidy_tweets %>% 
              count(candidate, name = "total")) %>%
  mutate(freq = n/total)

frequency <- frequency %>% 
  select(candidate, word, freq) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = candidate, values_from = freq) %>%
  arrange(Clinton, Trump)

ggplot(frequency, aes(Clinton, Trump)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 2.5, width = 0.25, height = 0.25) +
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) +

  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  geom_abline(color = "red")

```{r}
word_ratios <- tidy_tweets %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word, "^@")) %>%
  count(word, candidate) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  filter(sum(n) >= 10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = candidate, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~(. + 1) / (sum(.) + 1))) %>%
  mutate(logratio = log(Trump / Clinton)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(logratio)))
